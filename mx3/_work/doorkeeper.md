I help its founder and principal developer <a class='hint' href='http://www.tokyodev.com'>Paul McMahon</a> bring iterative UX improvements every month during a design & implementation sprint that usually runs for a few days.<br/><br/>Since we started, we've been able to completely brushup Doorkeeper's design language, create a new identity, completely overhaul the onboarding process, design a new free trial strategy, redesign the main dashboard of the app and the list goes on. Here's what Paul said about working with me:<br/><br/>
<blockquote>Mathieu's diverse skillset has been incredibly valuable with driving my product forward. Despite my product being mature and complex, Mathieu was able to quickly dive in and start producing value with minimal guidance. By combining a strong understanding of design principles, with the technical knowhow of how to implement designs using the latest technologies, he's delivered pragmatic solutions to the challenges I present him with. Mathieu's been a pleasure to work with and I wholeheartedly endorse him.</blockquote>"
