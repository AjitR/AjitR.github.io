I led workshops to gather necessary inputs from SMEs and visualized overall terminal flow for various use cases. After understanding entire supply chain and a terminal flow, I designed a timeline based UI which works on shift hours and updates the user with real-time inventory. The project gave me lot of scope to iterate with various kinds of data visualization concepts.Second part of the project involved simplification of planning and scheduling of orders for multiple modes of transport. After studying the underlying pattern of ordering process, I designed the UX framework which is intuitive to use and easy to customize based on customers’ business needs."
