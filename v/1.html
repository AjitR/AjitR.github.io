Hi How are you?
I know last time I messaged you were on vacation and after that I did not msg back. Sorry for that. I realized that it would be ok to take my time to msg properly.
This is going to be a long msg and I know that it feels very anxious to  receive such msg and read through it thus I have created this link so that you can read it at your own pace or ignore completely. Iâ€™ll leave that upto you.
