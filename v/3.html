It’s been a year since our initial breakup, and I still feel sad about the whole thing and  maybe that won’t change. But I’ve made peace with it, sort of. While trying to get back together, if you remember I was saying that I can forgive you  completely and I just need that push/love from you which will help me do it. During my counseling sessions, I realized that forgiving can not be dependent on anything. And the point where I was saying that I will trust you completely Dheere dheere is also not possible based on conditions and situations.
