Sometimes I feel like just calling and asking how are you and what’s happening in life…but  then after thinking for a while decide to not give/take pain by doing that.
I don’t know what you will feel from all this but I hope it something neutral or positive side.
There are many things I want to say to you like but I don’t want you to feel that I’m bugging you. I don’t know if there will be a time when we would talk  normally in future, but lets see…nothing can be discarded..
Miss you!
