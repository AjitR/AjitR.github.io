I’m saying all of this and  I expect no reply no nothing…. I just want you to know that I forgive you wholeheartedly. I can say that I understand…I can say that things happen, maybe shouldn’t have happened….but it has… I can be at peace and without the emotional stress about it if I can forgive you unconditionally. I don’t know if knowing this is of any concern to you or not..but I felt that I should just tell you.
