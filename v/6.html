I have to say this that what we had was very beautiful and  the best thing in my life, but  still  somehow we both managed to fuck it up. I wish I can live that part just for few moments. But time has passed and there is nothing which can be done to bring it back. I was struggling with an emotion  called hope. Again I worked with the counselor on that, it was something  which was holding me back in the hole. I think I have  reached a point where I can day that I no longer cling  on to that hope. But one thing to mention that I will still save that 1% in me, consciously because come on..you are special for me and at the same time wonâ€™t get affected in adverse way by it.
