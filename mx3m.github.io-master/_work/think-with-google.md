runin:            "In 2013, Google decided it was time to share their incredible research and data analysis work with the rest of the online marketers. TwG has been a trustful source of consumer trends and market insights since then. <br/><br/>Shortly after a successful launch in the US, I worked with <a class='hint' href='http://www.aqworks.com'>AQ</a> and Google on creating a separate platform for the Asian Pacific markets. The interface needed to work for several asian languages such as Korean, Thai or Japanese as well as English."
